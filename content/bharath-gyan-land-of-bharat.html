Puranas have mentioned Bharat Varsha as one land.
Al-Biruni, a Persian Chronicler from 1032CE, visited India along with Muhammad Ghazni. He chronicles his observations into a book "Kitab Al-Hind".
He says the division of Prathama is Primary one. The division of Bharat Varsha is secondary one. There is still third division into 9 parts.
1. Panchala
2. Magadha
3. Kalinga
4. Avanti, Ujjain
5. Ananta
6. Sindhu &amp; Sauvira
7. Hara Haura
8. Madura
9. Kulinda

From Al-Biruni's statement we can gather that even though there were independent kingdom's and distinct geographical regions, there were looked at as one single country called Bharat Varsha.
