<u><b><span style="font-size:medium;">My Bio for the event</span></b></u>
<div>

Graduated from  BIT in 2005 from the department of IT and started my career with Infosys. Have 11 years of experience in the IT industry now. Worked on various projects ranging in a variety of technologies from Banking, Retail, Embedded technologies, Defense systems and cloud computing technologies.

I have developed software for building control systems like heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems to run on memory constrained, processing power constrained devices, which are mainly used in big corporations for their control systems..

I was in France for 2 years, working with a company called Thales on a project for the Indian Air force, where I developed Mission Planning &amp; Debriefing System which is used to prepare mission data with information about the terrain, location and configuration of treats placed by the enemies, and counter-actions possible. These systems are loaded on the fighter planes and used by pilots during their missions, and analyze the information recorded during the mission.

When I was studying in college, I worked on a DRDO research project to train neural networks to recognize images, under the superior guidance of Dr. Amitabh Wahi. I gained immense knowledge and experience working under Dr.Wahi in the areas of Image Processing and Neural Networks.

Currently I am working with VMware, dealing with Cloud &amp; Virtualization technologies. I am responsible for delivering our Cloud Management products as SaaS offering. I work on the full stack of technologies in a DevOps profile ranging from some of the latest trending technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Distributed Control Plane as well as UI technologies like Angular.
