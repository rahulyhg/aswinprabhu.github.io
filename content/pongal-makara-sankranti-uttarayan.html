The 4 days from the last day of Tamil month Margazhi (usually Jan 13) till the 3rd day of Tamil month Thai (usually Jan 16) are celebrated across India.

The last day of Margazhi is celebrated as Bhogi in sothern India, and as Lohri in Punjab particularly. In Punjab Lohri is celebrated as the beginning of the harvest season.

The 1st day of Thai is more celebrated as Pongal in TN, and as Makara Sankranti, Uttarayanam, Maghi, Bihu, etc in the rest of India. This day marks the start of the sunâ€™s six-month-long journey northwards (Uttaraayanam). Also the sun enters the 10th zodiac Makaram. Hence it is called variously in various parts of India.

This represents the beginning of harvest season in most part of India. Precisely why it is called Uzhavar Thirunal in TN. It is celebrated as thanks giving to the sun, the cattle, which supported people in getting their harvest. People worship the Sun on this day, which is classified as Saura in the Shanmata given by Adi Shankara.

Even in Mahabharata, Bhisma gets pinned down by the arrows shot by Arjuna. But since he was blessed with Ichcha Mrutyu, he waits for Uttarayanam, as he also considered it an auspicious time of year, for him to shed his mortal body. Per Mahabharata, the war ends before Uttarayanam and Bhisma chose his time of death as Uttarayanam.

Not being restricted to India, it is also celebrated in countries like Nepal, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, etc, which share a common Hindu/Buddhist tradition. The Hindu/Buddhist traditions share a whole lot of core values and calendar.

Pongal / Makara Sankranti / Uttarayan / etc wishes to everyone :-)
