When you start learning from every minute of your life to imbibe positive qualities, ‘If I am patient with my colleagues who put up a plastic smile when they see me and talk ill out of earshot, why cannot I be patient towards my aging parents who have tolerated my mindless chattering and mischief during childhood and have given me the education to take on the world?
Why cannot I be loving towards my wife who takes care of all my needs, and understands my anxieties and tries her best to support me? Why cannot I be tolerant towards my children who are just doing what I would have done at their age? Why cannot I share love and care with my neighbours who share their happiness with me and who come rushing to help me in my troubled times?
Maybe I should start experimenting the way Baba told me. Let me start filling myself with only positive thoughts, spreading waves of love to everyone around me, and maybe it will bear results. Maybe everyone will become happy, and they will become the carrier of positive thoughts to wherever they go. The atmosphere will thus become positively charged and the world will become a happy place to live in’.
