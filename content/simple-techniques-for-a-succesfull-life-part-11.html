Start with your family, spread it to your neighbours, increase the radius step by step, casting the aura of your positive thoughts wherever you go.
Trust me when I say this, the world will definitely become a better place. That is how God created the world anyway, it is you people who have soiled it by your petty ways. The world is a bundle of all your thoughts and emotions, so if you can positively charge the place around you, and if everyone joins hands in that effort, even without being aware, the world will surely become the place God created it as.
