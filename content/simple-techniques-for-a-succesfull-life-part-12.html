Start loving your family members. Even if you are unable to start looking upon them as an aspect of God – – I have often told you ‘see the Lord Siva and Mother Goddess Shakthi in your parents, look upon your children as Muruga or Krishna, see your spouse as some aspect of God, even if your mother-in-law comes with a knife to strike you, imagine that Goddess Kali is rushing to test your patience– begin by remembering that they too are actors in this drama of life, and for your life to be a good entertainer, you should not forget your lines or the part that God has given you to play.
Therefore, fill yourself with love, and nothing but love. You may think, ‘It is very easy for You to say so, Baba, but when they hurt me with their words and actions, it is very difficult to be loving towards them’. Have you ever pondered over this – – is it you who are clinging on to the feeling of hurt or is it the hurt that is sticking to you?
If you fall down and mud clings to your shirt, don’t you immediately brush away the mud and wipe your shirt clean? Or will you live with the dirt? How long will it take for you to brush away the hurt and carry on with life?
