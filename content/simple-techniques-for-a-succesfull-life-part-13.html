The next time your husband shouts at you unnecessarily soon after he returns from office, think to yourself ‘Poor guy! He must have had a very poor day to be yelling at me like this. I must be extra loving and caring towards him today so that he will get over the hurt and return to the normal loving self he is’.
Bring to your mind certain incidents where he has expressed his care to you. When you start expressing love and kindness, he will feel bad and will apologise, ‘Sorry ma, today was a hectic day and the manager is a pain. He is taking credit for every single idea I give and trying to hog the limelight’. Once he cools down, patiently but without sermonising, tell your husband God will definitely give him his due; Tell him ‘Remember Baba has told us not to worry and that Rewards are always from the skies.’
