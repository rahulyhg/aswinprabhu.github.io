The next time your wife gets up late or has forgotten to add salt to your lunch or has not ironed your shirt on time, replay her kind acts when you yelled at her for no fault of hers. If she can be so considerate to you, you too can be more understanding and save time by not reacting.
The few minutes extra you wait or maybe offer to help her cook, or express your apologies that you had not helped her, and she had to hurry through cooking or maybe she was feeling tired, which was why the dish was not of the usual high standard. Offer to help her, and encourage her to ask for help if you forget to. You will make her feel good and you can feel the warmth of love glowing at home.
