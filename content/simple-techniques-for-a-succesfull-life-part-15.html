The next time your children play havoc at home and break the TV or your laptop, do not burst out and rage at them. Take a deep breath, spool on to your mind-screen those times in your childhood when your parents had to toil to make a few pennies and you destroyed the hard-earned tube-light. Your situation is much better than your parents, isn’t it; your spending power is thousand times higher.
As your children attempt to flee the scene of destruction, gather them to you patiently, tell them with a smiling face that you understand they did not expect this to happen, request their assistance to pick up the broken pieces and clean up the room and then they themselves will tell you ‘Appa, henceforth outdoor sports we will play outside and indoor games we will play inside’.
