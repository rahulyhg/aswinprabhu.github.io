The next time your teenage daughter approaches you crying that her batchmate has been piling love letters on her and torturing her to accept his ‘love’, place a comforting arm over her shoulder, thank her for treating you as her friend and reaching out to you with her problem, tell her it is normal for this age to be distracted by physical attractions, but as Baba has said, it is important to focus on studies, get a good score in the university degree and settle in a good career before thinking about the next phase of life.
Ask her to invite the boy home (Baba laughs, ‘if he is a good boy and his interest is genuine, he will come, else that one invitation is enough to make him run away and one torture less for your daughter’). If he does come and meet you, explain the same thing to him and tell him once they both settle in a career, you will help him take the proposal forward by arranging a meeting with both families. Issue settled amicably, don’t you think so?
