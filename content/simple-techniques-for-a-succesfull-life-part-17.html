The next time your aged parents keep chatting with you while you are busy with some impending deadline, do not shout at them. Remember that as a kid, you were chattering away to them while they were deep in work, and they always had a kind word for you. They were almost proud of your incessant chatter because you were the apple of their eye.
Now that they have grown old, they are in their second childhood and are reaching out to you to be assured of your love and care. Do all you can to make them understand that you love them and are willing to spend your time with them.
