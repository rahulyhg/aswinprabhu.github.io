The next time your colleague speaks ill about you out of spite do not bother. Harbour sympathy for him because his boorish attitude stems from jealousy or incapability, and either directly or indirectly help him to put in efforts that will make him too a good performer and he grows beyond self-pity into self-confidence. You will not lose anything; by training others, you will grow.
The next time your manager yells at you for no fault of yours, do not show any reaction. Do a self-introspection to see if his feedback holds anything for you to learn and grow, if yes, work on your improvement areas, if not, do not hold any grudge. When he is in a calmer mood and does not correlate it to his shouting, just casually tell him how grateful you feel that God has given you such a good manager who is focussed on bringing out the best in you. It will appease his stressed nerves and he will, without his knowledge, start being more appreciative of your efforts. It will give you a good payback in office too.
