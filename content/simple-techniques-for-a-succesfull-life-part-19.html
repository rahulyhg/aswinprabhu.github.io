The next time someone trods on your feet in the bus, and maybe apologises or just looks shocked at you thinking you will scream at them, just smile (yes, it is difficult but easy when you work on it) and assure them you understand they did not do it on purpose. They will become your bus-friends. Whoever you meet, greet them with a smile. Make it a habit to say ‘thank you’ to the liftman, the bus conductor, the servant maid, the security guard – – all these persons who make a living by doing menial service for you. You will be creating a congenial atmosphere wherever you are and will be the most wanted person wherever you go.
In essence, do not carry hurt or anger, just erase it, learn from the experience to become a better human being. That is what I mean by living in the minute. Remember the story of the king and the sandalwood merchant I have told you; thought waves have a way of influencing people around, so if you spread love, you get love, if you spread anger and hatred, that is what you will get. Learn to spread love and you will receive love. It is always give and take, never the other way around.
