The next time something happens in your life to distress you, do not blame God for letting you down, thank Him for taking care. Worse could have happened but HE is carrying you on HIS Shoulders and so just a shadow of distress has crossed your path. No harm can befall Godâ€™s devotees. Count your Blessings, not your tears, and you will be appreciative of, and grateful to God for His countless blessings.
Fear is a prime impediment for performance; do not go through life fearing the worst. Keep performing to excellence trusting in the Powers of the Almighty and the results will be mind-blowing. Count your Blessings, not your fears, and you will understand that you too are divine and limitless, and all it requires is for you to start trusting in your potential.
