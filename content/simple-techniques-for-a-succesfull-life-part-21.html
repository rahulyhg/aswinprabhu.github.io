Reflect over what I have said, and you will realise that having a happy life or a life full of misery and discontent, is all in your hands. Take the choice today – to be happy, take a healthy view of life and circumstances, and make life easy for you and for people around you.
Lead a life of excellence to understand the divinity that you are. You are all chosen ambassadors of God’s Mission, for spreading love and cheer in this world. Lead your life wisely and well and make Him proud of you.
