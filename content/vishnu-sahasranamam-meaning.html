The <a title="Vishnu" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Vishnu">Vishnu</a> Sahasranam is found in the Mahabharatha. Literally translated this means thousand names of <a title="Vishnu" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Vishnu">Vishnu</a>. This is found in the Anushasanika Parvam (chapter relating to orders or rules to the kings) of Mahabharatha.

Bheeshma Pitamaha was defeated and grievously wounded by <a title="Arjuna" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Arjuna">Arjuna</a>. But since he could choose the time of his death as per the boons received by him, he chose to die in Uttarayana and was waiting for the auspicious time. Meanwhile the war was over leading to death of all those male members in his family except the Pancha Pandavas and the unborn child of <a title="Abhimanyu" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Abhimanyu">Abhimanyu</a>. Yudishtra the eldest of the Pandavas became the King of Hasthinapura and whom else would he go for advise other than Bheeshma the great. Anushasanika Parva is in the form of questions and answers between Yudishtra and Bheeshma Pitamaha.To <a title="A" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/A">a</a> question as to what is the best possible <a title="Stotra" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Stotra">stotra</a>, Bheeshma answers that it is the <a title="Vishnu" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Vishnu">Vishnu</a> Sahasra Nama and teaches it to Yudishtra.

Though it describes one thousand aspects and praises of the lord, it is not simple and easy to understand. Many great Acharyas lead by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sankara" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Sankara">Sankara</a> Bhagavat Pada, felt <a title="A" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/A">a</a> need to give its meaning in crystal clear terms so that the devotee can not only sing but meditate on the aspect of the God he is praising. But this again was done in <a title="Sanskrit" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. With the modern civilization several translations of this <a title="Stotra" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Stotra">stotra</a> is available in English and in almost all major languages of India.

Though it is called Sahasra Nama in fact it contains only 901 distinct sounding names. Eight hundred and fifteen names are repeated once, Seventy-five of these names are repeated twice, nine of these names thrice and two of these names four times. The acharyas have attempted to give different meanings to the same word in different places successfully.

In the afterward to the <a title="Stotra" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Stotra">stotra</a> Goddess Parvathi asks Siva the cosmic god for an easy way to sing this <a title="Stotra" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Stotra">stotra</a> for the learned. He replies that it is sufficient that the learned one repeats the name of <a title="Rama" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Rama">Rama</a> and this is equivalent to his singing of sahasranama. It is important to note that this is easy method is prescribed to the very learned who do not have time to recite it daily and not for everybody,

That purusha with endless devotion,
Who chants the thousand names ,
Of He who is the lord of the Universe,
Of He who is the God of Gods,
Of He who is limitless,
Would get free,
From these bondage of life, cruel

He who also worships and prays,
Daily without break,
That Purusha who does not change,
That Vishnu who does not end or begin,
That God who is the lord of all worlds,
And Him, who presides over the universe,
Would loose without fail,
All the miseries in this life.

Chanting the praises,
Worshipping and singing,
With devotion great,

Who is the truth among all those who has life,
And who decides the life of all living,
Is the <a title="Dharma" href="http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Dharma">dharma</a> that is great.

That which is the greatest light,
That which is the greatest penance,
That which is the greatest brahmam,
Is the greatest shelter that I know.

Please hear from me,
The thousand holy names,

Which wash away all sins,
Of Him who is purest of the pure,
Of That which is holiest of holies,
Of Him who is God among Gods,
Of That father who lives Without death,
Among all that lives in this world,
Of Him whom all the souls,
Were born at the start of the world,
Of Him in whom, all that lives,
Will disappear at the end of the world,
And of that the chief of all this world ,
Who bears the burden of this world..

I would teach you without fail,
Of those names with fame.
Which deal of His qualities great,
And which the sages sing,
So that beings of this wide world,
Become happy and great.

But He is one,
And he divides himself,
And exists in all beings,
That is in three worlds,
And rules all of them,
Without death and decay.

To protect those who are good,
And to destroy all who are bad.

If he who is sad,
If he who is broken,
If he who is afraid,
If he who is severely ill,
If he who has heard tidings bad,
Sings Narayana and Narayana,
All his cares would be taken care of.
